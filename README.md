# Red-Wine-EDA
Basic Exploratory data analysis for the red-wine data, which I imported from Kaggle has been done.
I have tried to explore the following:
- How the data looks like, sample size 
- Data types and if missing values are there in the data
- I have plotted histograms for each variable in the dataset, and have also calculated skeweness to understand if variables resemble normal distribution or not
- There are also box plots to uderstand the distribution of data
- I have also calculated the number of variables which either lie below 2 standard deviations from mean or above 2 standard deviations from mean, in order to get information on outliers
